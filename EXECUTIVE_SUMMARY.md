# Blog Post Value Proposition - OpenCost GPU Monitoring Tutorial

This technical tutorial addresses critical challenges in enterprise AI infrastructure management by providing practical, step-by-step guidance for implementing GPU cost visibility in Kubernetes environments across four key customer use cases: (1) infrastructure decision-making for enterprises comparing on-premises TCO against cloud alternatives, (2) multi-tenant cost allocation enabling organizations to track GPU expenses by namespace (or other Kubernetes dimensions) for accurate chargeback across teams, business units, or tenants (in the case of ISVs) sharing the same cluster, (3) cross-environment cost visibility allowing hybrid and multi-cloud platforms to compare GPU spending consistently across AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI, and on-premises environments, and (4) node and cluster-level cost analysis empowering platform teams to aggregate costs across multiple Kubernetes clusters by different dimensions (namespace, pod, node, controller) for optimization. The blog post delivers complete configurations for both cloud (automatic pricing) and on-premises (custom pricing) deployments, specific Ingress controller setups for all major cloud providers, and practical API query examples for cost reporting and FinOps tool integration.
