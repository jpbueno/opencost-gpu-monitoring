## Verification Details

### Custom Pricing Configuration
```json
{
  "GPU": "0.95",
  "CPU": "0.031611",
  "RAM": "0.004237",
  "provider": "custom"
}
```
✅ Verified in pod: `/tmp/custom-config/default.json`

### Services Running
```
NAME                            READY   STATUS
pod/opencost-55999696cf-rf4x4   2/2     Running

NAME                  TYPE        PORT(S)
service/opencost      ClusterIP   9003/TCP,9090/TCP
service/opencost-ui   NodePort    9090:30091/TCP,9003:30031/TCP
```

### API Endpoints Tested
- ✅ `/healthz` - Responding
- ✅ `/allocation?window=1h` - Returns 200
- ✅ UI HTML page - Loading correctly

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Namespace Creation Order
**Problem:** Original blog post applied opencost-config.yaml before namespace existed, causing NodePort service creation to fail.

**Fix:** Updated Step 3 to create namespace first:
```bash
kubectl create namespace opencost
kubectl apply -f opencost-config.yaml
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in blog post

### Issue 2: Redundant Namespace Creation
**Problem:** Step 4 had `kubectl create namespace opencost` but namespace was already created in Step 3.

**Fix:** Removed redundant command from Step 4.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in blog post

## Blog Post Updates Made

1. ✅ Added cleanup section with uninstall commands
2. ✅ Fixed namespace creation order in Step 3
3. ✅ Added verification commands
4. ✅ Removed redundant namespace creation from Step 4
5. ✅ Added log checking command
