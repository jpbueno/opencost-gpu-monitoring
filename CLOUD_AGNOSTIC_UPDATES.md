# Cloud-Agnostic Updates - Blog Post

## Summary of Changes

The blog post has been updated to support **any environment** and **any NVIDIA GPU type**.

## Key Updates

### 1. Title & Scope
**Before:** "Monitoring GPU Costs in On-Premises Kubernetes with OpenCost and DCGM"
**After:** "Monitoring GPU Costs in Kubernetes with OpenCost and DCGM"

**New Supported Environments:**
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud: AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS, OCI OKE
- üè¢ On-Premises: Bare metal, VMware, OpenStack
- üîß Any Kubernetes 1.20+

### 2. GPU Pricing Section (Massively Expanded)

Added comprehensive pricing for:

#### Cloud Pricing Examples
- **AWS:** H100 ($12.29/hr), A100 ($4.10/hr), A10G ($1.01/hr), T4 ($0.53/hr)
- **GCP:** H100 ($3.37/hr), A100 ($1.62/hr), L4 ($0.95/hr)
- **Azure:** A100 ($3.67/hr), T4 ($0.53/hr)

#### On-Premises Calculation Methods
- **Option A:** Amortized hardware cost (with formula)
- **Option B:** Power + datacenter overhead (with TDP examples)
- **Option C:** Cloud-equivalent internal chargeback

#### GPU Pricing Quick Reference Table

| GPU Model | Typical On-Prem | AWS | GCP | Azure |
|-----------|----------------|-----|-----|-------|
| H100 80GB | $3-5/hr | $12.29/hr | $3.37/hr | N/A |
| A100 80GB | $0.95-2/hr | $4.10/hr | $1.62/hr | $3.67/hr |
| A100 40GB | $0.50-1/hr | $3.06/hr | $1.21/hr | $2.76/hr |
| A10 24GB  | $0.30-0.50/hr | $1.33/hr | $0.78/hr | $1.09/hr |
| V100 32GB | $0.40-0.80/hr | $3.06/hr | $2.48/hr | $3.06/hr |
| T4 16GB   | $0.20-0.40/hr | $0.53/hr | $0.35/hr | $0.53/hr |
| L4 24GB   | $0.30-0.50/hr | $0.77/hr | $0.95/hr | N/A |

### 3. Access Methods (Environment-Specific)

#### For Cloud Environments
- **LoadBalancer** (recommended) - with commands
- **Ingress** (production) - with full YAML example
- **Port Forward** (dev/test)

#### For On-Premises
- **NodePort** (default configuration)
- **MetalLB LoadBalancer** (if available)
- **Port Forward** (dev/test)

### 4. Cost Examples Section

Replaced single environment example with multiple scenarios:

**H100 Training Example:**
```
8x H100 GPUs (AWS p5.48xlarge)
24 hours: $2,359.68/day
```

**A100 Inference Example:**
```
4x A100 GPUs (on-premises)
24/7: $2,736/month
```

**T4 Batch Processing Example:**
```
16x T4 GPUs (AWS g4dn)
8 hours/day: $67.84/day
```

**Multi-GPU Cluster Example:**
```
Production Cluster:
‚îú‚îÄ 8x H100:  $70,790/month
‚îú‚îÄ 12x A100: $35,424/month
‚îú‚îÄ 20x T4:   $3,816/month
‚îî‚îÄ Total:    $110,030/month
```

### 5. Configuration Updates

Updated `opencost-values.yaml` comments:
```yaml
GPU: 0.95  # GPU-hour - CHANGE THIS based on your GPU!
           # H100: 3-12/hr, A100: 1-4/hr, V100: 0.5-3/hr, T4: 0.2-0.5/hr
```

### 6. New Section: Environment-Specific Considerations

#### Cloud-Specific Tips
- **AWS:** Spot instances, Savings Plans, Cost Explorer
- **GCP:** CUD, preemptible VMs, sustained use discounts
- **Azure:** Reserved Instances, Azure Spot, Cost Management
- **OCI:** Lower GPU pricing, flexible shapes

#### On-Premises Tips
- Track full TCO (power, cooling, space)
- Include hardware depreciation
- Account for maintenance costs
- Consider hybrid cloud for burst capacity

### 7. Production Recommendations Expanded

Added new recommendations:
- Multi-GPU type support (labels, SKU tracking)
- Cloud-specific optimization strategies
- Spot/preemptible instance usage
- GPU time-slicing for efficiency
- Off-peak scheduling

### 8. Updated Footer

**Before:**
```
Environment: On-Premises DGX A100 Cluster
OpenCost Version: 1.117.6
```

**After:**
```
Supported Environments: AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI, On-Premises
Supported GPUs: H100, A100, A10, V100, T4, L4, and all NVIDIA GPUs
OpenCost Version: 1.117.6
```
